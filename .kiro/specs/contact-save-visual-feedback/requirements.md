# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the visual feedback for the contact save functionality in the vCard plugin. Currently, the save contact button shows a heart icon that changes from outline to solid when saved, but users need clearer visual indication that their contact has been successfully saved. The enhancement will add a red color state to the save button when a contact is saved, making it immediately obvious to users that the action was successful.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing a vCard profile, I want the save contact button to show a clear red color when I have saved the contact, so that I can immediately see the saved state without having to remember or guess.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the save contact button THEN the button SHALL change to a red background color
2. WHEN a contact is already saved and the page loads THEN the save contact button SHALL display with a red background color
3. WHEN a user clicks the save contact button to unsave a contact THEN the button SHALL return to its original color scheme
4. WHEN the save contact button is in the saved state THEN it SHALL maintain the red color on hover while still providing visual feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the red save button to be visually distinct from other action buttons, so that I can quickly identify which contacts I have saved across different profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the save contact button is in saved state THEN it SHALL use a red color that is distinct from other action button colors
2. WHEN hovering over a saved contact button THEN it SHALL show a darker red hover state
3. WHEN the button transitions between saved and unsaved states THEN it SHALL use smooth CSS transitions for better user experience
4. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the red saved state SHALL remain clearly visible and accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the save button color changes to be accompanied by proper accessibility indicators, so that I can understand the button state regardless of color perception.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the save contact button changes to saved state THEN the title attribute SHALL update to reflect "Contact Saved ❤️"
2. WHEN the save contact button is in unsaved state THEN the title attribute SHALL show "Save Contact"
3. WHEN the button state changes THEN screen readers SHALL be able to announce the state change
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the saved state SHALL remain distinguishable from the unsaved state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all action buttons (phone, whatsapp, email, etc.) to have consistent styling with the contact management buttons, so that the interface looks cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing quick action buttons THEN they SHALL use the same styling format as contact-action-btn buttons
2. WHEN hovering over quick action buttons THEN they SHALL show consistent hover effects with contact management buttons
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN all action buttons SHALL maintain consistent sizing and spacing
4. WHEN buttons are displayed together THEN they SHALL have uniform appearance while maintaining their distinct colors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the vCard plugin, I want the red save button enhancement to integrate seamlessly with the existing contact management system, so that no existing functionality is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the red save button enhancement is implemented THEN all existing save/unsave functionality SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN a contact is saved or unsaved THEN the localStorage management SHALL continue to function as before
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the button state SHALL be correctly initialized based on existing saved contacts data
4. WHEN multiple contacts are saved THEN each profile's save button SHALL independently show the correct state
