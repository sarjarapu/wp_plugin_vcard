# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive database schema validation and synchronization system for the vCard WordPress plugin. The system will ensure that all SQL table schemas are consistent between the initial plugin activation and the CRUD operations performed throughout the codebase. This addresses the critical issue where temporary fixes and ad-hoc alterations have created inconsistencies between table creation scripts and the actual operations, potentially causing plugin activation failures on fresh WordPress installations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Database Schema Audit and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to audit all existing database schemas and CRUD operations, so that I can identify inconsistencies between table creation and actual usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system runs THEN it SHALL scan all PHP files in the plugin for database table references and CRUD operations
2. WHEN table schemas are analyzed THEN the system SHALL compare CREATE TABLE statements with actual column usage in INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT queries
3. WHEN inconsistencies are found THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report listing missing columns, incorrect data types, and unused columns
4. WHEN the audit completes THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for schema corrections and optimizations
5. WHEN validating table constants THEN the system SHALL ensure all VCARD_*_TABLE constants are properly defined and consistently used

### Requirement 2 - Schema Synchronization and Migration System

**User Story:** As a plugin administrator, I want an automated schema synchronization system, so that database tables are always consistent with the codebase requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is activated THEN the system SHALL create all required tables with complete and accurate schemas matching CRUD operation requirements
2. WHEN schema differences are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply necessary ALTER TABLE statements to bring tables up to date
3. WHEN migrating existing data THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing data while adding missing columns with appropriate default values
4. WHEN creating new installations THEN the system SHALL ensure tables are created with the most current schema version from the start
5. WHEN upgrading the plugin THEN the system SHALL handle schema migrations incrementally without data loss

### Requirement 3 - CRUD Operation Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that all CRUD operations match the actual table schemas, so that database operations never fail due to schema mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN INSERT operations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate that all referenced columns exist in the target table
2. WHEN UPDATE operations are executed THEN the system SHALL verify that SET clauses reference valid columns with compatible data types
3. WHEN SELECT queries are run THEN the system SHALL confirm that all referenced columns and indexes exist
4. WHEN JOIN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate that foreign key relationships are properly defined
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating the specific schema mismatch

### Requirement 4 - Fresh Installation Deployment Validation

**User Story:** As a WordPress site administrator, I want the plugin to work perfectly on fresh installations, so that I can deploy it on any WordPress website without database-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed on a fresh WordPress site THEN all required database tables SHALL be created successfully with complete schemas
2. WHEN plugin activation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify that all table creation was successful before marking activation as complete
3. WHEN database creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback any partial changes
4. WHEN testing fresh installations THEN the system SHALL include automated tests that verify plugin functionality on clean WordPress instances
5. WHEN validating deployment readiness THEN the system SHALL confirm that no temporary fixes or manual interventions are required

### Requirement 5 - Schema Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want comprehensive schema documentation and maintenance tools, so that future database changes are properly managed and documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically update documentation with current table structures and relationships
2. WHEN new tables are added THEN the system SHALL generate proper CREATE TABLE statements with all necessary indexes and constraints
3. WHEN columns are modified THEN the system SHALL create migration scripts that can be applied to existing installations
4. WHEN reviewing database design THEN the system SHALL provide visual schema diagrams and relationship mappings
5. WHEN maintaining the codebase THEN the system SHALL include automated tests that prevent schema drift and inconsistencies

### Requirement 6 - Cleanup and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to remove all temporary fix files and optimize database performance, so that the plugin codebase is clean and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL remove all temporary fix files (fix-database.php, debug-database.php, test-upgrade.php)
2. WHEN optimizing schemas THEN the system SHALL ensure all tables have proper indexes for performance-critical queries
3. WHEN consolidating code THEN the system SHALL move all database-related functionality into proper class methods rather than standalone scripts
4. WHEN validating performance THEN the system SHALL include query optimization and index usage analysis
5. WHEN completing cleanup THEN the system SHALL ensure that all database operations are handled through the main plugin architecture without external scripts
