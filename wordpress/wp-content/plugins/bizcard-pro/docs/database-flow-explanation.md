# Database Schema Flow Explanation

## How the Tables Connect (Relationships)

```
WordPress Users (wp_users)
    ↓ (one user can have multiple profiles)
wp_bizcard_profiles (MAIN TABLE)
    ↓ (one profile has many...)
    ├── wp_bizcard_services (multiple services per business)
    ├── wp_bizcard_products (multiple products per business)  
    ├── wp_bizcard_gallery (multiple images per business)
    ├── wp_bizcard_styling (one styling config per business)
    ├── wp_bizcard_subscriptions (billing info per business)
    ├── wp_bizcard_analytics (tracking events per business)
    ├── wp_bizcard_reviews (customer reviews per business)
    └── wp_bizcard_certifications (awards per business)

End Users can save profiles:
wp_bizcard_saved_contacts → wp_bizcard_profiles
```

## Implementation Flow (Step by Step)

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
**Create these tables first:**
1. `wp_bizcard_profiles` - The main business data
2. `wp_bizcard_styling` - How profiles look
3. `wp_bizcard_subscriptions` - Basic billing

**Why this order?**
- You can create and display basic business profiles
- You can test the styling system
- You can handle payments

### Phase 2: Content Features  
**Add these tables:**
4. `wp_bizcard_services` - Business services
5. `wp_bizcard_products` - Business products
6. `wp_bizcard_gallery` - Image galleries

**Why this order?**
- Now businesses can add rich content
- Profiles become more comprehensive
- Still manageable complexity

### Phase 3: Engagement Features
**Add these tables:**
7. `wp_bizcard_analytics` - Track views and clicks
8. `wp_bizcard_saved_contacts` - End users saving contacts
9. `wp_bizcard_reviews` - Customer feedback

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Add these tables:**
10. `wp_bizcard_certifications` - Professional credentials

## Real Example Data Flow

Let's say "John's Pizza Shop" signs up:

1. **User Registration**: John creates WordPress account → `wp_users`
2. **Profile Creation**: John fills out business info → `wp_bizcard_profiles`
3. **Styling**: John picks "warm" theme with red colors → `wp_bizcard_styling`  
4. **Payment**: John pays $99/year → `wp_bizcard_subscriptions`
5. **Content**: John adds pizza services → `wp_bizcard_services`
6. **Images**: John uploads pizza photos → `wp_bizcard_gallery`
7. **Visitors**: People view John's profile → `wp_bizcard_analytics`
8. **Engagement**: Customers save John's contact → `wp_bizcard_saved_contacts`

## Sample Queries You'd Run

```sql
-- Get a complete business profile
SELECT p.*, s.style_theme, s.primary_color 
FROM wp_bizcard_profiles p 
LEFT JOIN wp_bizcard_styling s ON p.id = s.profile_id 
WHERE p.id = 123;

-- Get all services for a business
SELECT * FROM wp_bizcard_services 
WHERE profile_id = 123 AND is_active = 1 
ORDER BY display_order;

-- Count profile views this month
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wp_bizcard_analytics 
WHERE profile_id = 123 
AND event_type = 'view' 
AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);

-- Check subscription status
SELECT status, current_period_end 
FROM wp_bizcard_subscriptions 
WHERE profile_id = 123;
```

## Why This Structure Works

**Flexibility**: JSON fields let us store complex data without rigid schemas
**Performance**: Proper indexes on frequently queried fields
**Scalability**: Each table focuses on one concern
**WordPress Integration**: Uses WordPress user system and follows WP conventions
**Data Integrity**: Foreign keys ensure data consistency

## WordPress Integration Points

- **wp_users**: Links to WordPress user accounts
- **wp_posts**: Could integrate with WordPress posts for SEO
- **wp_postmeta**: Could store additional profile metadata
- **wp_options**: Store plugin settings and configuration

This gives you a solid foundation that can grow with your needs!
