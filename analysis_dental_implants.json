      "Dental technology has made remarkable strides over the past several years. One of those involves a cutting-edge procedure designed to replace missing teeth: dental implants . It\u2019s no wonder why so many dentists and dental patients alike are choosing dental implants as a method to replace one or more missing teeth. The process itself takes some time to complete, but the end result is very much like having a brand new natural tooth! That\u2019s why Dr. Bowcutt is so pleased to provide dental implant services to his patients from throughout the Cedar Park, TX, area.",
      "A dental implant consists of a metal rod (typically made from titanium) that is inserted into the jawbone of the patient. After a period of several months, the metal fuses to the bone tissue. This creates what is essentially an artificial tooth root. After that, Dr. Bowcutt affixes a porcelain crown to the top of the implant. The result is a new artificial tooth \u2013 one that not only looks like and functions just the same as a natural tooth, it is also extremely strong and durable. In fact, dental implants often last the patient for a whole lifetime!",
      "Dental implants are, without a doubt, a great choice for some people. But they may not be right for every patient. In order to accommodate an implant, you\u2019ll need to have sufficient bone tissue present in your jaw. If your jawbone is compromised in any way \u2013 as may be the case for patients suffering from advanced gum disease, for example \u2013 a dental implant may not work for you. Talk to Dr. Bowcutt to find out if you are a good candidate for an implant.",

We offer many different types of dental restorations to replace broken or missing teeth. We offer fillings to fill in any broken teeth and use a natural looking cement so they blend in with the rest of your teeth. We also offer bridges which \u201cbridge\u201d the gap between teeth. They are often cemented into place. We offer dentures, either full or partial, depending on how many teeth you are missing. Once we are finished with your mouth, you will love to show your new smile off!",
      "Of all the options we offer, dental implants are considered by most dentists to be the longest lasting, most durable, and most attractive replacements for missing teeth. By replacing the root of a missing tooth as well as the crown, implants are the closest restoration to a natural tooth. The American Academy of Implant Dentistry has stated that implants are the \u201cnext best thing to healthy, natural teeth.\u201d Rooted in your jaw, implants are unlikely to need replacement in your lifetime!",
      "The implant itself looks like a small screw, and it functions as the foundation for beautiful dental restorations. Implants securely attach restorations of all sizes to the jaw, from single crowns, to bridges, to dentures. These restorations are generally made from ceramic or another biocompatible material, and are matched to your teeth so they blend right in.",
      "Getting an implant does require an initial surgical procedure. Your Cedar Park, TX implant dentist makes a hole in the jawbone, and the implant is carefully placed. Following this, you will wait a few months while the implant takes hold, and will typically be provided a temporary crown or restoration by your implant dentist to fill the gap in the interim. Over time, the bone and tissue build up and anchor the implant in a process called \u2018osseointegration.\u2019",
      "Unfortunately, not everyone is a candidate for dental implants. For an implant to take hold, a candidate must have proper bone density and have a strong immune system. If you are an adult in good health, you may be a good candidate for implants. In all cases, dental implants require strict oral hygiene and are not recommended for smokers.",
      "Like any restoration, implants require diligent oral hygiene and proper care to ensure they last a long time. According to a study by the Academy for Oral Implantology in Austria, implants have a 97 percent success rate.

      "What is a dental implant?",
      "A dental implant is a small titanium screw that serves as the replacement for the root portion of a missing natural tooth. Dental implants can be placed in either the upper or lower jaws. Due to the biocompatible properties of titanium, a dental implant fuses with the bone and becomes a good anchor for the replacement tooth. Dental implants can be used in solutions for replacing single or multiple missing teeth.",
      "Why dental implants?",
      "There are a number of reasons why you should consider a dental implant:",
      "Without the root structure of a natural tooth present, the jawbone can shrink. This shrinkage will make your face look older than it is. There are no loose parts to worry about losing. The dental implant is stable and comfortable. No adjustment is needed after placement. Normally, it will serve its owner for life. Are dental implants successful?",
      "With more than three decades of clinical experience and over a million patients treated, statistics confirm a success rate of nearly 95 percent for individual Nobel Biocare dental implants*, and even higher for the bridges they support.",
      "* Results based on dental implants and dental bridges remaining and in function over a five-year period."
